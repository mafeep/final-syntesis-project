<h5>Electric energy</h5>
<p>
  Is the power an atom's changed partides have to cause an action to move and
  object. The movement of electrons from one atom's to other is what results in
  electrical energy. As an example, this is a direct electric circuit that
  consists of a lightbulb and a battery.

<h5>Watt</h5>
<p>
  The standard unit of power in the international system of units (SI), equal to
  the power in a circuit in with current of on ampere flows across a potencial
  difference of one volt. This is the equation of Watt in function of Ampers and
  Volts.

<h5>Scatter plot</h5>
<p>
  A Scatter plot uses dots to represents values for two different numeric
  variables. The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis
  indicates values for an individual data point. This chart materializes the
  relationship between the number of some species of animal and the passing of
  the years.

<h5>Linear regression</h5>
<p>
  Is a model of the relationship between two things for predictive analysis. In
  which one is dependent and the other is independent. This is the linear
  regression of the former scatter plot, it is the line that represents all
  those points the best way possible.

<h5>Renewable energy</h5>
<p>
  Renewable energy is energy from natural sources that are replenished at a
  higher rate than ther are consumed. Sunlight and wind, for example, are such
  sources that are constantly being replenished. This image shows two sources of
  renewable energy: windmills and solar panels.
