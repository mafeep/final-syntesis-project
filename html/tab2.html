<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    It can be observed that this linear regression tends to behave as a
    proportionally direct relationship, it responds to the huge increase of the
    consumption in the third and the fourth month. That's why it is shown as if,
    with the pass of the months, it keeps on increasing. As well as you can say
    the pendant or inclination of the line is medium big, as it is 12. In this
    case, the months are the independant variable and the kWh the dependant.
  </li>

  <li>
    In general terms, the dots are not so disperse from the linear regression.
    But they are specially accurate in the first two months, in the other ones
    you can notice that the true value dots are further away from the grey
    points. So that, the predictions up to the future could be less or more
    precise.
  </li>
  <li>
    The estimation, prompted by the equation, enunciates that for a next month
    the consumed KWH will be: $$y = 5.5 \cdot 6 + 167.3$$ $$y = 167.3$$
  </li>
  <li>
    Given its high tendencies in the last few months, it can be deduced that the
    usage of electric comodities and lightbulbs has increased significantly.
    Partly, it was due to visits at home, but still the consumption is high and
    can and will be reduced. will be through actions such as: showering with
    cold water, unplugging chargers and other cable when they're not being used,
    using low power lamps and lightbulbs and turning them off when unused. If it
    was a bit more economically acquireable, another great option would be using
    renewable sources of energy to get the energy out of, because they do not
    damage as much as regular ways of deriving energy.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis1Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    An increasing propotional relationship can be observed withing the
    regression graph because it follows the tendency that the greater the number
    of residents the greater the consumption of KWh. As one increases, the other
    on does as well. In this case, the residents are the independant variable
    and the kWh the dependant.
  </li>
  <li>
    In this chart, some points are a bit more disperse from the line of the
    regression. For example, in the fifth month, the true value point is way
    lower than the pont the regression represents. Duee to that, you can say the
    relationship is not as tight. But, overall, it speaks for the other months
    quite well.
  </li>
  <li>
    The estimation, prompted by the equation, enunciates that for residential
    unit with 200 residents the consumed KWH will be: $$y = 87.11 \cdot 200 -
    174.82 $$ $$y = 17247.18$$
  </li>
  <li>
    The behavior really makes sense because it is plausible that, increasing the
    number of residents, the number of kWh consumed will indeed increase too,
    because more people tend to use more electronic devices, hot water and
    lights. Also, for such a big number of people, it would be needed a bigger
    house that, at the same time needs more light and energy.
  </li>
</ul>
