<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    From analyzing the graph, it can be deduced that the initial regression is
    108.6 KWh and with each month it increases until finally obtaining 143 KWh.
  </li>
  <li>
    The gray dots are from the regression line, this is an overall average of
    the energy consumption, and the red dots are the specific or true data of
    the energy consumption of my house.
  </li>
  <li>
    According to the calculation, in month 6 I will consume 151.6 KWh $$ y =
    8.60 \cdot 6 + 100.00 $$ $$ y = 151.6 $$
  </li>
  <li>
    In conclusion I can say that in the last month the energy consumption has
    increased a lot since we have left for longer than usual the different
    devices connected, and have been used more this, this analysis helps me to
    create awareness to make it decrease and help with the environment.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    a direct relationship is seen because the greater the number of residents
    the greater the consumption of KWh. It can be evidenced that where two
    residents live it is between 88 and 155 KWh, where 3 people live there is a
    data that is lower than normal and where 5 people live there is a data very
    similar to where 4 live. Where they live 6 is the highest of the data that
    is the highest of the behavior.
  </li>
  <li>
    Where 2, 3 and 4 people live, one point of each is very close and one could
    say that it agrees with the regression line, although some values are a
    little higher and others lower than the regression line. 5 is lower than the
    gray line and 6 is higher than the regression line.
  </li>
  <li>
    in the unit with 200 people will consume 13511.3 $$ y = 67.79 \cdot 200 +
    -46.70 $$ $$ y = 13511.3 $$
  </li>
  <li>
    It can be evidenced that in most of the houses where there are more
    residents, the higher the energy consumption, because more people use
    electricity, with cell phones, chargers, televisions, computers, the more
    people have these electronic devices the higher the energy consumption.
  </li>
</ul>
