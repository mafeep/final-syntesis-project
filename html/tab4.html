    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
      </p>
      <ul>

        <Li> In the table, a decrease in linear regression can be visualized as expected from the data. However, since it is calculated based on the number of people in a given month, it can vary greatly or slightly. </Li>
        
        <Li> As can be seen in the table, the relationship between the gray data and the color data indicates that they only come close in two months, which are the first with a difference of 7.4 kWh and the third with a difference of 4.2 kWh, compared to the rest which have a difference of 21.7kWh, 27.1kWh, and 19kWh in months: 2, 4, and 5 respectively. It can be concluded that even though linear regression can be used to approximate the data, it will not necessarily be exactly the same as the actual data. </Li>
        
        <Li> I approximately will consume 158.9kwh in the next month, by the formula:
        
        Y= -6.10(6) + 195.50
        Y= 158.9 </Li>
        
        <Li> I can conclude that it is possible to maintain the energy consumption of February (144 kWh), as it is suitable for the number of people in the household. This can be achieved by turning off lights when they are unnecessary and not leaving cables connected when they are not being used for essential purposes. </Li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
    <div id="analysis3Plot2"></div>
    <p id="analysis3Eqn2" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    
    <ul>
    
      <Li>The linear regression increases as it predicts the next data based on the previously given data; in the table, we can see that it approaches the real data (real consume). </Li>
      
      <Li>A direct relationship is observed as the number of residents increases, so does the consumption of kWh. It can be seen that where three residents live, consumption is between 79 and 144 kWh; where four people live, there is one data point that is lower than normal (53 kWh); where five people live, there is data that is very similar to where four people live. Where seven people live, the highest value of all is found with 475 kWh.</li>
      
      <li>In the case of where three and four people live, one point for each is very close to the regression line, indicating agreement with it. However, some values are slightly higher and others lower than the regression line. The data point for where five people live is lower than the gray line, and the one for where seven people live is higher than the regression line by 69 kWh.</Li>
      
      <Li> I approximately will consume 15,456.78kWh in the next month, by the formula:
      
      Y= 77.98(200)+-139.22
      Y= 15,456.78kWh </Li>
   
      <Li>It can be concluded that many of the data points align with the prediction made by the regression line since that is precisely its purpose - to predict the behavior of the variable. Although it does not always closely approximate the data, in attempting to be predictive, it will not give an entirely exact result.</Li>
      </ul>
