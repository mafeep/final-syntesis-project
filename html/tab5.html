<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    By looking at the graph, we can infer that the regression starts at 135KWh
    and as the months pass, it shows a small decrease in the first two months
    out of the six selected compared to the others, as it drops to 123KWh and
    then increases slightly to 125KWh, however, it significantly increases until
    it reaches the last value, which is deduced to be 155KWh.
  </li>
  <li>
    The gray dots shown are the linear regression, whereas the ones shown in a
    different color represent the actual energy consumption of my home. By
    looking at the graph, it is noted that the months with the greatest
    difference between the gray dots and the colored dots are months 1, 3, and
    5, while the others do not show a significant distance.
  </li>
  <li>
    According to the calculation, in month 6 I will consume 151.20 KWh $$ y =
    5.40 \cdot 6 + 118.80 $$ $$ y = 151.20 $$
  </li>
  <li>
    In conclusion, by observing the graph, I have been able to see how different
    the results are, as they do not remain at a maximum or a minimum.
    Nevertheless, I realized that even though there are few people in the house,
    we leave many devices connected that consume more energy. This inquiry has
    made me more aware of my spending habits at home because often what is being
    consumed is an unnecessary device.

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis4Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis4Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    It is observed that it is not a direct relationship, as the greater the
    number of residents, the greater the consumption of KWh, but in some cases,
    this is not well-defined. It can be observed that where two people live,
    consumption is between 93 and 137 KWh, where three people live, consumption
    ranges from 127 to 222 KWh, where four people live, consumption is minimal
    and varies between 89 and 110 KWh, where six people live, the consumption is
    similar to that of four people, and where seven people live, the highest
    value of the entire behavior is recorded.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is observed that there is a small difference between the points of the
    regression line and the actual consumption points. Where two people live,
    the consumption is very similar and quite close to the regression line.
    Where three people live, only one point is close to the regression line, but
    the other data is not far away. Where four people live, both data points are
    far from the regression line. Where there are six people, the points are
    observed as being close together, and the most distant data point from the
    regression line is where the actual consumption is 475KWh, which is the
    highest consumption and where seven people live.
  </li>
  <li>
    in the unit with 200 people will consume 10,259.37$$ y = 51.35 \cdot 200 +
    -10.63 $$ $$ y = 10,259.37$$
  </li>
  <li>
    It can be evidenced that expenses are, in one way or another, independent of
    the number of residents, although it is obvious that the more residents
    there are, the more energy will be consumed, since there will be a greater
    use of electrical appliances, thus resulting in higher energy consumption
  </li>
</ul>
